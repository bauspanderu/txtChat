# txtChat
A chat application that relies solely on text files. To use with multiple people, put room files onto a shared drive. Good for applications where other chat apps fail because of firewalls or other blockers.

## Creating a room
To create a new room, create two files in the same folder, one named "yourname.cha", and one named "yourname.cha.onl". You need both, they have to be in the same folder and have the same name, otherwise txtChat will not accept the room.
